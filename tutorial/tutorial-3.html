                    <p>In addition to fundamental research, technical analysis is also a method that many people use to interpret investment market movements. The candlestick chart is a type of technical analysis, which records the price changes of the market over a period of time.

                    <p>With just one K-line, you can know the opening price, closing price, highest price and lowest price of a certain target during this period. Combining the candlesticks for a period of time can draw a candlestick chart with time on the horizontal axis and price on the vertical axis.</p>

                    <br/>   
                    <p>The market is changing every second. K line can simplify the information and present the trend of the stock price in a visual way, allowing us to see the opening price, closing price, highest price and lowest price for a period of time. A single candlestick can illustrate the sentiment of the market from opening to closing during that period, so candlesticks are also regarded as the basics of technical analysis.</p>
